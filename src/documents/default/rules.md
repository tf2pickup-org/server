1. The main language used on mumble and in the game is **Polish**. Do not add to the pickup queue if you are not comfortable with using Polish for the in-game communication.
2. _tf2pickup.pl_ was created with Team Fortress 2 **competitive gameplay** in mind.
3. _tf2pickup.pl_ is not the place to learn Team Fortress 2 competitive basics. It is expected of every player to know the 6v6 lineup as well as responsibilities of each class. One must also know the basics of the class they are going to play (i.e. rollout for soldiers or demo, healing order for medic, etc.).
4. **Mumble is obligatory**. Do not add to the pickup queue if you do not have the Mumble application installed and configured properly. Please make sure your voice is clear and audible.
5. Take the pickup matches seriously. Do not mess around and waste the game for the rest of players. **Ruining the pickup matches will be punished**.
6. Readying up for the pickup means you can play the entire 30 minutes of the match. Not joining the game, leaving the pickup mid-game or not being able to focus on the match will be punished.
    1. If you are forced to leave the game, find a substitute player for yourself and give him all the game details. Also, let your team know you are to be replaced.
   2. After the match is started, server configured and the connect string provided, players have 7 minutes to join the right channel on the mumble server, the game server and ready up.
7. Offclassing is limited to flank classes (scouts and/or roamer). The engineer and pyro can be used to defend, and heavy to defend or attack last point. Sniper and spy can be taken to attack or defend last as well as break stalemates during the match. **Offclassing to mid is strictly prohibited.**
8. **Swapping classes or teams is prohibited.**
9. All forms of cheating, using alternate accounts and attempts to utilize unfair advantages against other players will be punished.
